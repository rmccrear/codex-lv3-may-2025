### TODOs for Day 3

* TODO: Solve the [Bee puzzles](https://studio.code.org/courses/course1/units/1/lessons/14/levels/1) as a warmup to loops. Be sure to click on "Show Code" in each lesson to see what is going on under the hood. If you are curious about for loops, have a look at the [explainer on code.org](https://studio.code.org/docs/concepts/javascript/for-loops/). We will see for-loops in the following lessons.
* ~~TODO: Start with [Loops Explore](https://studio.code.org/courses/course1/units/1/lessons/14/levels/1) and answer the question. Don't take too long on this!~~
* TODO: Move on to [Loops Investigate](https://studio.code.org/courses/csp-2025/units/6/lessons/6/levels/1). There is not much to do, but a lot to observe and investigate.
* TODO: Work on [Loops Practice](https://studio.code.org/courses/csp-2025/units/6/lessons/7/levels/1) and get some good practice with Loops.
* TODO: Finally, work on [Loops Make](https://studio.code.org/courses/csp-2025/units/6/lessons/8/levels/1) to create your own app with loops.
* Challenge: Have a look at this old lesson. Try and see how a loop might have helped. https://studio.code.org/courses/csd-2024/units/3/lessons/5/levels/8/sublevel/2

Loops are one of the basic building blocks of algorithms. Being able to use loops will unlock a whole new avenue of programming!
