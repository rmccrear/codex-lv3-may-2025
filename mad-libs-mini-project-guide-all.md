# Level 7: Template Literals and Story Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my personalized Mad Libs story with my words inserted so that I can laugh at the funny result.

## What You'll Do
Generate the Mad Libs story using JavaScript template literals and form data.

## Instructions
- Create the story template using template literals
- Insert form data into the story template
- Send the complete story as HTML response

## ðŸ’¡ Code Hints
Need help with template literals? Check out these snippets:
- **Template literals:** Use backticks and `${variable}` syntax
- **Story template:** Create a complete story with placeholders
- **HTML response:** Use `res.send()` to send HTML

Show Me: template literal syntax

```javascript
const name = "Alice";
const adjective = "silly";
const story = `Once upon a time, ${name} was feeling very ${adjective}.`;
```

Show Me: story template structure

```javascript
const storyTemplate = `
    <h1>Your Mad Libs Story</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, ${name} went to the ${noun1} and found a ${adjective1} ${noun2}.</p>
`;
res.send(storyTemplate);
```

## ðŸš€ Pro Tip
**Practice with dummy variables first!** Before using the real form data from `req.query`, create your story template with hardcoded dummy values (like `name = "Alice"`, `adjective = "silly"`). This helps you:
- Test your template literal syntax
- Verify your story structure works
- Debug any formatting issues
- Then replace the dummy values with the real `req.query` variables

## âœ… Check

## Instructions
- Add CSS styling to the story display HTML
- Include Bootstrap CSS link in the HTML head
- Create a styled layout for the story
- Add navigation links back to the form
- **Important:** This CSS is added inside your server route response, not in a static file

## ðŸ’¡ Code Hints
Need help with styling? Check out these snippets:
- **CSS in server route:** Add complete HTML with CSS link in your `res.send()`
- **Bootstrap CDN:** Include Bootstrap CSS link in the HTML head
- **Navigation:** Add links with `href="/mad-libs-form.html"`

Show Me: complete HTML with CSS in server route

```javascript
const storyHTML = `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <title>Your Mad Libs Story</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container mt-5">
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h1 class="card-title">Your Mad Libs Story</h1>
                <p class="card-text">${storyContent}</p>
                <a href="/mad-libs-form.html" class="btn btn-primary">Create Another Story</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>`;

res.send(storyHTML);
```

Show Me: basic story structure

```html
<div class="container mt-5">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h1>Your Story</h1>
            <p>Story content goes here...</p>
            <a href="/mad-libs-form.html">Create Another Story</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

## âœ… Check
1. Submit your form and view the story
2. The story should be displayed with Bootstrap styling
3. You should see a navigation link back to the form
4. The page should look professional and responsive
5. **Important:** The CSS is loaded from the CDN link in your server response

## ðŸš¨ Important Note
**Server Route vs Static Files:** Unlike your form HTML file (which is static), the story display HTML is generated dynamically in your server route. This means you include the CSS link directly in the HTML string that you send with `res.send()`.
