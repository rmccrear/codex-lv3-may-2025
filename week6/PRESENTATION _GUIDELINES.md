# Presentation Guidelines

For your final presentation, you will showcase your React project connected to Supabase. This is your opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of React concepts, Supabase integration, and deployment on Netlify. Please ensure you address the following topics clearly and concisely.

## Presentation Template

Use the [Capstone Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MJU5MpcpPiWJL1-voo-bJXKNMJZZ-UTKA276-mxQJEs/edit?usp=sharing) to structure your slides.

## Presentation Setup

You can present from localhost or your deployed version, but **be sure to have a deployed version to share!** This allows others to access and explore your app independently.

## 1. Introduction (30 seconds)

Start with a brief introduction of yourself:
- Your background before getting into tech
- How you got into tech
- What tech you are interested in working with

*This is your chance to showcase your future goals!*

## 2. Project Pitch (2 minutes or less)

Give a concise pitch about your project:
- Describe the problem space
- Explain the pain point
- Show how your app fills the gaps

## 3. App Tour (Less than 5 minutes)

Give a tour of your app:
- Highlight the best points
- Demonstrate key features
- Show the user experience

## 4. Code Deep Dive (5+ minutes)

Dive into the code. Fire up VS Code and choose one of these to talk about:
- What you learned
- What you are proud of
- A major blocker or bug that you overcame

*Try to make this a story/journey of your progress as a developer over the course of building your app.*

## 5. Future Plans (1-2 minutes)

Give a wish list of what you would do if you had more time:
- What's next on the timeline for your app?
- What features would you add?
- How would you improve it?

## 6. Q&A

Leave time for questions from our guests!
