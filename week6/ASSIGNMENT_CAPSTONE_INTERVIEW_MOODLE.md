# Capstone Project Interview

## Objective

Demonstrate your understanding of the code you've written and your ability to implement features live. This interview simulates real-world technical interviews where you'll be asked to code and explain your work.

---

## Interview Components

### Part 1: Live Coding Challenge (50%)
You will be given a coding task related to your capstone project that you must complete during the interview.

**Possible tasks include:**
- Add a new feature to your existing code
- Fix a bug or error in provided code
- Implement a list pattern (map, filter, or reduce) on the spot
- Write a function to fetch or create data
- Add validation to a form
- Style a component using CSS or Bootstrap

**You will be expected to:**
- Think out loud and explain your approach
- Write clean, working code
- Use proper syntax and conventions
- Handle errors appropriately
- Ask clarifying questions when needed

### Part 2: Project Demonstration & Discussion (50%)
Demonstrate your capstone project and discuss your implementation decisions.

**Be prepared to:**
- Show your deployed application working
- Walk through your code structure and components
- Explain your database design and table relationships
- Discuss why you chose specific datasets from Code.org
- Explain how you used map, filter, and reduce patterns
- Discuss challenges you faced and how you solved them
- Show your planning worksheet and explain your design decisions

## Pre-Interview Requirements

### Submit Before Interview:

1. **Planning Worksheet Link**
   - Share your completed planning Google Doc
   - Ensure all sections are completed

2. **GitHub Repository Link**
   - Ensure your code is pushed to GitHub
   - Repository should be public or shared with instructor

3. **Deployed Site Link**
   - Working application on Netlify or Vercel
   - All features functional

4. **Pre-Interview Reflection** (submit on Moodle)
   Answer these questions (200-300 words):
   - What was the most challenging part of building your capstone project?
   - What are you most proud of in your project?
   - If you had more time, what would you add or improve?
   - What did you learn about React and Supabase that surprised you?

## What to Prepare

### Code Review
- Review all your code files
- Understand each component's purpose
- Be ready to explain your file structure
- Know where your list patterns (map, filter, reduce) are implemented
- Be familiar with your for-loop implementation

### Live Coding Practice
**Practice these types of tasks:**
- Creating a new React component
- Adding state with useState
- Writing form handlers
- Fetching data from Supabase
- Using map/filter/reduce on arrays
- Styling components with CSS

**Practice on platforms like:**
- [React Katas](../week5/kata/README.md) - Practice exercises for React and list patterns
- CodeSandbox.io
- Your own project (add test features)
- Recreate small versions of your components

### Technical Knowledge
Be ready to discuss:
- How React components work
- The difference between props and state
- When to use useEffect
- How Supabase client library works
- What list patterns do and when to use them
- How async/await works
- How you debugged problems

### Project Story
Prepare to explain:
- Why you chose your specific datasets
- How your external data relates to your user data
- Your design choices (why Bootstrap or custom CSS)
- Any features you wanted to add but couldn't
- What you'd do differently next time
