## Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Planning Worksheet
📋 Open and make a copy of the [Capstone Planning Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GT_9HHmCe1kTSk-67HErz-HNocPdi_Uqw8g698Kx5Ig/edit?usp=sharing)

**Or use the markdown version:** [Planning Worksheet](../week6/CAPSTONE_PLANNING_WORKSHEET.md)

### Step 2: Complete All Sections
Work through the worksheet systematically:

**Phase 1: Initial Planning & Brainstorming**
- Review at least 3 Code.org datasets that interest you
- Brainstorm 1-2 app ideas with target users and value propositions
- Create a 2-minute pitch for your ideas
- Participate in group voting on ideas
- Decide whether to work solo or in a group

**Phase 2: Detailed Planning & Design**
- Finalize your app plan (external data + user data)
- Create wireframes for:
  - Splash screen/home page
  - Data display screen (Report Page)
  - Form page
- Plan your Supabase table structures with columns, data types, and relationships
- Download your chosen Code.org dataset as CSV

**Phase 3: Coding & Implementation Planning**
- Create a 5-day timeline with specific goals for each day
- Complete the technical checklist as you build

### Step 3: Share Your Worksheet
- Make your Google Doc shareable with your instructor
- Ensure all sections are completed
- Add your name and date at the top

## Tips for Success

✅ Start early - good planning saves time during development  
✅ Research Code.org datasets thoroughly before choosing  
✅ Think about your "Why?" - what problem does your app solve?  
✅ Keep wireframes simple - focus on functionality over design  
✅ Plan realistic goals - better to under-promise and over-deliver  
✅ Collaborate if working in a group - communication is key
