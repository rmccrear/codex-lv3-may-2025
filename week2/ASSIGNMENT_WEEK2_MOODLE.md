   - No repeated code for similar elements

4. **Personalization**
   - Replace placeholder content with your actual work
   - Update hero section with your information
   - Custom styling reflecting your personal brand

5. **Code Quality**
   - Clean, readable code
   - Props passed correctly
   - Meaningful component and variable names
   - Comments explaining key sections

6. **Documentation**
