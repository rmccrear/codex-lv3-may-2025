# Vitest Testing Assignment

## Objective
Learn to write and run tests using Vitest by following the step-by-step guide and completing the practice exercises.

---

## Assignment Overview

You will work through the Vitest learning guide, setting up a testing environment and writing tests for functions. This assignment will teach you the fundamentals of test-driven development and how to use Vitest as a testing framework.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Learning Guide
📖 **Start here:** [Vitest Learning Guide - Level 1](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week8/function-practice/vitest-levels/vitest-lv-1.html)

**📚 Full Guide:** Navigate through all 46 levels using the navigation links at the top of each page.

**Note:** The guide is broken into multiple levels. Start at Level 1 and work through each level sequentially using the navigation at the top of each page.

### Step 2: Complete the Setup
Follow Level 1 to:
- Initialize an npm project
- Install Vitest
- Configure your `package.json` for ES6 modules
- Verify your setup works

### Step 3: Work Through the Guide
Complete all levels in the guide:
- **Levels 1-7:** Introduction and setup
- **Levels 8-22:** Adding more tests and edge cases
- **Levels 23-35:** Red-green-refactor cycle
- **Levels 36-46:** Challenge exercises (building and composing functions)

Use the navigation links at the top of each page to move between levels.

### Step 4: Complete Challenge Levels
The challenge levels (marked with ⚡ in navigation) require you to:
- Build functions from scratch
- Write tests first (red-green-refactor)
- Compose functions together
- Choose your own function cluster to practice

## Required Deliverables

Submit the following through Moodle:

1. **GitHub Repository Link**
   - Create a new repository for your Vitest practice
   - Include all your test files and function files
   - Make sure the repository is public or shared with your instructor

2. **Screenshot of Passing Tests**
   - Show all tests passing (green) in your terminal
   - Include at least 10+ passing tests

3. **Code Examples**
   - Share at least 3 function files with their corresponding test files
   - Include examples from the challenge levels

4. **Brief Reflection** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What did you learn about testing?
   - How does writing tests first (red-green-refactor) change your coding process?
   - What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?

## Grading Criteria

- **40%** - Setup and Configuration (Vitest installed, package.json configured correctly)
- **30%** - Test Coverage (At least 10 passing tests covering various scenarios)
- **20%** - Challenge Completion (At least 2 challenge levels completed)
- **10%** - Code Quality (Clean, readable code with proper function structure)

**Total: 100 points**

## Tips

- Start with Level 1 and work sequentially
- Don't skip ahead - each level builds on previous concepts
- Use the "Show Me" sections if you get stuck
- Practice the red-green-refactor cycle on the challenge levels
- Test edge cases (empty strings, zero, negative numbers, etc.)
