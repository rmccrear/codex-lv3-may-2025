Mad Libs is a word game where players fill in blanks in a story with random words (like nouns, verbs, and adjectives) without knowing the context. The result is usually a funny and nonsensical story!

**Goal:** Set up your development environment and understand the project requirements.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a new project folder with all necessary files so that I can start building my Mad Libs application.

## What You'll Do
Create a new project folder and set up all the necessary files to get started.

## Instructions
- Make a new folder for your project named `mad-libs-project`
- Navigate to the project folder and run `npm init -y` to create package.json
- Inside, create these files:
  - `server.js`
  - `public/mad-libs-form.html`
  - `README.md`


## âœ… Check
Open your project folder in VS Code and verify you can see all files:
- `server.js`
- `package.json`
- `public/mad-libs-form.html`
- `README.md`

If any files are missing, create them before moving to Level 2.
