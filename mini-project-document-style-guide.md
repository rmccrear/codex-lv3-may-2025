## Document Structure

### Header Format
```markdown
# üéØ [Project Name] Project Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for building [description] using [technologies].

Your [technology] version will have similar [features] but with your own creative twist!

**Structure:**
- Each level builds on the previous one
- Clear instructions and checkpoints
- Code examples and hints provided
- Progressive complexity from basic to advanced
```

### Level Structure
Each level should follow this consistent format:

```markdown

## Code Examples

### HTML Structure for Code Blocks
```html
<details>
<summary>Show Me: [descriptive title]</summary>

<pre><code class="language-[lang]">[code content]
</code></pre>

</details>

**Screenshot Reference:** (Optional)
![Description of what the screenshot shows](./path/to/screenshot.png)
```

### Code Block Guidelines
- **Language tags:** jsx, javascript, css, html, bash, markdown
- **Indentation:** Use 2 spaces for consistency
- **Comments:** Include helpful comments in code
- **Escaping:** Use HTML entities for special characters in code blocks
- **Completeness:** Provide complete, runnable examples
- **Screenshots:** Include when showing visual results or UI changes

### Code Content Standards
- Use modern syntax and best practices
- Include error handling where appropriate
- Show both simple and advanced approaches
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Include comments explaining key concepts

---

## Visual Elements

### Emojis and Icons
- **üéØ** - Project titles and main goals
- **üí°** - Code hints and tips
- **‚úÖ** - Check sections and verification
- **üî¨** - Experiments and explorations
- **‚ö°** - Challenge levels
- **üéâ** - Completion celebrations
- **üìã** - Planning and organization

### Formatting Standards
- **Bold text:** For emphasis and key terms
- **Code spans:** For file names, function names, variables
- **Code blocks:** For multi-line code examples
- **Headers:** Use consistent hierarchy (H1 for project title, H2 for levels)

### Tables
Use tables for:
- Planning templates
- Test cases
- Checklists
- Comparison charts

**Table Format:**
```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Content | Content | Content |
```

## Progressive Complexity

### Level Progression
1. **Setup levels (1-3):** Environment, basic structure
2. **Core functionality (4-8):** Main features and interactions
3. **Enhancement levels (9-12):** Polish, styling, advanced features
4. **Architecture levels (13-15):** Component organization, patterns
5. **Completion levels (16-17):** Documentation, deployment
6. **Challenge levels (18+):** Optional extensions

### Difficulty Indicators
- **No indicator:** Standard level
- **üí™ Practice Challenge:** Similar to previous level
- **‚ö° CHALLENGE LEVEL:** Advanced optional content
- **‚≠ê Easy/‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium/‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Hard:** For challenge extensions

## Language and Tone

### Writing Style
- **Active voice:** "Create a component" not "A component should be created"
- **Direct commands:** "Add this code" not "You might want to add this code"
- **Encouraging tone:** Supportive but not condescending
- **Clear explanations:** Avoid jargon, explain technical terms

### Terminology
