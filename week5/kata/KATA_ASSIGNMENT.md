# Kata Practice Assignment

Practice React fundamentals through focused coding exercises (katas). Choose one kata to master and demonstrate your fluency on video.

---

## üìã Assignment Overview

**Goal:** Build muscle memory with React by practicing a kata multiple times, then record yourself completing it fluently while explaining your code.

**Time Commitment:** 
- Practice: 2-3 hours throughout the week
- Video: 5-10 minutes recording

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

### 1. Choose Your Kata

Select **ONE kata** from the list to practice:

**Recommended for Beginners:**
- Kata 1: Simple Greeting (Basic component)
- Kata 2: Welcome with Props (Props basics)
- Kata 3: Click Counter (useState basics)

**Intermediate:**
- Kata 4: Show/Hide Toggle (Boolean state)
- Kata 5: Fruit List (Array mapping)
- Kata 6: Name Input (Controlled inputs)

**Advanced:**
- Kata 7: Filter Even Numbers (Filter pattern)
- Kata 8: Search/Filter Names (Filter + state)
- Kata 9-11: Reduce pattern katas

### 2. Practice Multiple Times

- ‚úÖ Complete the kata at least **3-5 times** from scratch
- ‚úÖ Try doing it without looking at the solution
- ‚úÖ Focus on understanding, not memorizing
- ‚úÖ Practice explaining out loud as you code

### 3. Record Your Video

Create a 5-10 minute video where you:

**Show:**
- Screen recording of you coding the kata from scratch
- Your face (optional but encouraged via webcam)

**Do:**
- Complete the entire kata without referencing the solution
- Explain what you're doing as you code
- Describe why you're making each decision
- Run the code and show it working

**Talk About:**
- What this component does
- Why you're using specific React features (props, state, etc.)
- What each part of the code does
- Any challenges you faced while learning this kata

## üé• Video Guidelines

### Setup

**Tools you can use:**
- Loom (free, easy)
- Zoom (record yourself)
- OBS (free, more advanced)
- QuickTime (Mac built-in)
- Windows Game Bar (Windows built-in)

### What to Include

1. **Introduction (30 seconds)**
   - "Hi, I'm [name] and today I'm demonstrating [kata name]"
   - Brief description of what the kata does

2. **Coding (3-7 minutes)**
   - Code the kata from scratch
   - Explain as you type
   - Think out loud about your decisions

3. **Testing (1 minute)**
   - Show the component working
   - Test any interactive features
   - Demonstrate the expected output

4. **Reflection (1 minute)**
   - What did you learn from this kata?
   - What was challenging?
   - How would you extend or improve it?

### Tips for Success

- ‚úÖ Practice the kata several times before recording
- ‚úÖ Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- ‚úÖ It's okay to pause and think - that's natural!
- ‚úÖ If you make a mistake, explain how you'd fix it
- ‚úÖ Don't worry about perfect code - focus on explanation
- ‚úÖ Keep it under 10 minutes

## üìä Grading Rubric

### Completion & Accuracy (40%)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| ‚úÖ **Full Credit (40%)** | Kata completed correctly from scratch without referencing solution; code works as expected |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial Credit (25-35%)** | Kata mostly complete with minor errors; references solution briefly; mostly works |
| ‚ùå **Needs Work (0-20%)** | Significant errors; heavily relies on solution; doesn't run |

### Explanation Quality (40%)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| ‚úÖ **Full Credit (40%)** | Clear, confident explanation of what code does and why; explains React concepts accurately; demonstrates understanding |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial Credit (25-35%)** | Explains most code but misses some details; mostly accurate understanding; some hesitation |
| ‚ùå **Needs Work (0-20%)** | Minimal explanation; unclear understanding; struggles to explain choices |

### Presentation (20%)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| ‚úÖ **Full Credit (20%)** | Clear audio/video; well-paced; professional presentation; stays within time limit |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial Credit (10-15%)** | Audio/video okay; some pacing issues; slightly over/under time |
| ‚ùå **Needs Work (0-5%)** | Poor audio/video quality; too fast/slow; missing required sections |

**Total: 100%**

## üì§ Submission

Submit the following:

1. **Video Link** 
   - Upload to YouTube (unlisted), Loom, Google Drive, or similar
   - Make sure link is viewable by instructor

2. **Code Repository** (optional but recommended)
   - GitHub repo with your kata solution
   - Include a README with the kata name

3. **Reflection** (2-3 sentences)
   - What did you learn from this practice?
   - How will this help you as a developer?

## üí° Example Explanation Snippets

**Good explanations sound like:**

> "I'm importing useState from React because I need to track the count value and update it when the button is clicked. State allows React to remember this value between renders."

> "I'm using destructuring here with curly braces to extract the name prop. This is cleaner than writing props.name throughout my component."

> "This for loop checks each number to see if it's even by using the modulo operator. If the remainder is zero when divided by 2, that means it's even, so I push it into my filtered array."

**Avoid just reading code:**

‚ùå "Here I'm writing const count equals useState zero"  
‚úÖ "I'm creating state to track the count, starting at zero"

‚ùå "This is a button with onClick"  
‚úÖ "When this button is clicked, it calls handleClick to increment the count"

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I reference documentation while recording?**  
A: No, the goal is to demonstrate fluency. Practice until you can do it without references.

**Q: What if I make a mistake in the video?**  
A: That's okay! Explain what went wrong and how you'd fix it. This shows problem-solving skills.

**Q: Can I choose a kata not on the list?**  
A: Stick to the provided katas for this assignment, but feel free to practice others!

**Q: Do I have to show my face?**  
A: No, but it helps create a personal connection. Screen + voice is fine.

**Q: Can I edit my video?**  
A: Light editing is okay (trim beginning/end), but don't cut out the coding process.

**Q: What if my kata is very short (like Kata 1)?**  
A: Great! Spend more time explaining concepts in depth and discussing variations.
