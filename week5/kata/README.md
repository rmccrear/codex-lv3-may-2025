# React Katas ðŸ¥‹

Simple React exercises to practice core concepts from the [React Cheatsheet](../../REACT_CHEATSHEET.md).

**ðŸ“‹ [View Assignment Instructions](./KATA_ASSIGNMENT.md)** - Practice and record yourself completing a kata!

## What are Katas?

Katas are small, focused coding exercises designed to build muscle memory and reinforce fundamental concepts. Complete these in order to build your React skills!

## Kata List

### Basic Concepts (1-6)
1. **[Kata 1: Simple Greeting](./kata-01-greeting.md)** - Basic component and JSX
2. **[Kata 2: Welcome with Props](./kata-02-props.md)** - Props and destructuring
3. **[Kata 3: Click Counter](./kata-03-counter.md)** - useState and event handling
4. **[Kata 4: Show/Hide Toggle](./kata-04-toggle.md)** - Boolean state and conditional rendering
5. **[Kata 5: Fruit List](./kata-05-list.md)** - Array .map() to render lists
6. **[Kata 6: Name Input](./kata-06-input.md)** - Controlled inputs with state

### Filter Pattern (7-8)
7. **[Kata 7: Filter Even Numbers](./kata-07-filter-numbers.md)** - Filter pattern with numbers
8. **[Kata 8: Search/Filter Names](./kata-08-filter-search.md)** - Filter pattern with search

### Reduce Pattern (9-11)
9. **[Kata 9: Calculate Total Score](./kata-09-reduce-sum.md)** - Reduce pattern to sum
10. **[Kata 10: Calculate Average Rating](./kata-10-reduce-average.md)** - Reduce pattern to average
11. **[Kata 11: Count by Category](./kata-11-reduce-count.md)** - Reduce pattern to count

## How to Use These Katas

### Option 1: In Your Own Project

1. Create a new Vite React project:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest react-katas -- --template react
   cd react-katas
   npm install
   ```

2. For each kata, create the component in your project
3. Import and render it in `App.jsx` to test
4. Try solving without looking at the solution first!

### Option 2: In CodeSandbox

1. Go to [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/)
2. Create a new React sandbox
3. Complete each kata in the sandbox

### Option 3: Review Only

- Read through each kata
- Study the solutions
- Type them out to build muscle memory

## Tips for Success

- âœ… **Try first, then check** - Attempt the solution before looking
- âœ… **Type it out** - Don't copy/paste; typing builds memory
- âœ… **Understand, don't memorize** - Focus on why the code works
- âœ… **Experiment** - Try variations and see what happens
- âœ… **Use the cheatsheet** - Reference the [React Cheatsheet](../../REACT_CHEATSHEET.md) when stuck

## Concepts Covered

These katas reinforce:
- âœ… Component structure and JSX
- âœ… Props with destructuring
- âœ… useState hook
- âœ… Event handlers (onClick, onChange)
- âœ… Conditional rendering
- âœ… Array mapping
- âœ… Controlled inputs
- âœ… **Filter pattern** - Select items matching criteria (using for loops)
- âœ… **Reduce pattern** - Summarize/calculate from arrays (using for loops)

## Next Steps

After completing these katas:
- Build a small project combining multiple concepts
- Review your Week 2, 3, or 4 projects
- Prepare for your code interview!
