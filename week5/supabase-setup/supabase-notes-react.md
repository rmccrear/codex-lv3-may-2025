# Setting up React with Supabase

You'll need three files...



* Get the files from the connect tab [image11]
* Select the settings for your project [image12]
* Copy these three files in to your project [image13] (You may call them ts/tsx or js/jsx)
* Change them from `todos` to match your own table names and column schema. [image14]
* Watchout for this bug in the starter code! You may see it until it gets fixed. [image15] change `import { supabase } from '../utils/supabase'` to `import supabase from '../utils/supabase'`
