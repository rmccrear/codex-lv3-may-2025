## üîç Diving Deeper

**Why do we need these libraries?**

- **`@supabase/supabase-js`**: This is the official JavaScript client library for Supabase. It provides all the functions we need to connect to our database, perform queries, and handle authentication. Without it, we'd have to write complex HTTP requests manually.

- **`tslib`**: This is a TypeScript runtime library that Supabase depends on. Even though we're using JavaScript, Supabase's internal code uses TypeScript features, so we need this library to support those features.

**Where do these libraries go?**

When you run `npm install`, npm:
1. Downloads the libraries from the npm registry
2. Stores them in the `node_modules/` folder in your project
3. Updates your `package.json` file to record the dependencies

**How to verify installation:**

1. **Check `package.json`**: Open your `package.json` file and look for the `dependencies` section:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.x.x",
       "tslib": "^2.x.x"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Check `node_modules/`**: Look in your project folder for a `node_modules/` directory. Inside, you should see folders named `@supabase` and `tslib`.

3. **Verify in terminal**: Run `npm list` to see all installed packages and their versions.

## ‚úÖ Check

1. Run `npm run dev` to start your development server
2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`
3. You should see the default Vite + React welcome page
4. Check that `@supabase/supabase-js` is listed in your `package.json` dependencies
5. Open your project folder in VS Code and verify you can see the basic file structure

# Level 3: Database Setup

**Goal:** Configure your Supabase database with tables and security policies.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up my database tables and security policies so that I can store and retrieve potluck data securely.

---

## What You'll Do

Follow the Supabase setup guides to create your database tables and configure access policies.

## Instructions

- Complete the [Supabase Setup Guide](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.html) to create your account and project
- Create a `potluck_meals` table with these columns:
  - `meal_name` (text)
  - `guest_name` (text)
  - `serves` (integer)
  - `kind_of_dish` (text)
- Add at least 3 sample meals
- Set up [read policies](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.html#step-10-set-up-read-policy-allow-public-read-access) and [insert policies](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.html#step-11-set-up-write-policy-allow-public-write-access) for public access
- Follow the [Supabase React Setup Guide](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_REACT_SETUP_GUIDE.html) to configure environment variables
  - Remember to:
    - install your libraries. (supabase and tslib) [instructions](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_REACT_SETUP_GUIDE.html#step-7-install-supabase-client-library)
    - create your `.env.local` file in your project's **root** directory [instructions](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_REACT_SETUP_GUIDE.html#fix-3-use-envlocal-for-better-security)
    - create your supabase utility file in `src/util` Note: do not copy the code for `App.jsx` for this project. We will put the code into a component in later steps [instructions](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_REACT_SETUP_GUIDE.html#fix-3-use-envlocal-for-better-security)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note**: Do NOT use the starter code for `App.jsx` from the Supabase setup guide. That code puts everything in one file, but we'll be organizing our app into separate components. Follow the component structure outlined in Levels 4-6 below instead.

## üîç Diving Deeper

**What are Row Level Security (RLS) policies?**

- **Purpose**: Control who can access which rows in your database
- **Security layer**: Prevents unauthorized access to your data
- **Policy types**: SELECT (read), INSERT (create), UPDATE (modify), DELETE (remove)
- **Why we need them**: Without RLS, anyone with your database URL could access all your data

**Understanding our policies:**

```sql
-- Read policy: Allow everyone to read meals
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for all users" ON potluck_meals
FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Insert policy: Allow everyone to add meals  
CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for all users" ON potluck_meals
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
```

- **`USING (true)`**: For SELECT policies, means "allow if condition is true" (always true = everyone can read)
- **`WITH CHECK (true)`**: For INSERT policies, means "allow if condition is true" (always true = everyone can insert)
- **`true`**: Always evaluates to true, so these policies allow public access

**Environment variables explained:**

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

- **`VITE_` prefix**: Required for Vite to include these variables in your build
- **`.env.local`**: More secure than `.env` (automatically ignored by git)
- **Anon key**: Safe to use in frontend code (has limited permissions)
- **Service key**: Never use in frontend (has full database access)

## üîç Diving Deeper

**What is async/await?**

- **`async`**: Marks a function as asynchronous, meaning it can use `await` and will return a Promise
- **`await`**: Pauses execution until a Promise resolves, then returns the resolved value
- **Why we need it**: Database operations take time (network requests), so we need to wait for them to complete

**Understanding Supabase queries:**

```javascript
const result = await supabase.from("potluck_meals").select()
```

- **`supabase.from("table_name")`**: Specifies which table to query
- **`.select()`**: Retrieves all columns from the table (like `SELECT *` in SQL)
- **`result`**: Contains both `data` and `error` properties
- **`result.data`**: The actual data returned from the database
- **`result.error`**: Any error that occurred during the query

**Error handling pattern:**

Always check for errors when working with databases:
```javascript
if (result.error) {
    console.error('Database error:', result.error);
    return; // Stop execution if there's an error
}
```

# Level 7: Display Data with For Loop

**Goal:** Display the fetched meals using a for loop.

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the meals displayed on the page so that I can view what's planned for the potluck.

---

## What You'll Do

Add display logic using a for loop to render each meal in the list.

## Instructions

- Create a `mealsDisplay` array
- Use a for loop to iterate through the meals array
- For each meal, push a `<li>` element with the meal information
- Include the meal name, guest name, serves count, and dish type
- Display the meals using `{mealsDisplay}` in the JSX

## üîç Diving Deeper

**Why do we need the `key` prop?**

- **React requirement**: When rendering lists, React needs a unique identifier for each item
- **Performance**: Helps React efficiently update the DOM when the list changes
- **Best practice**: Use a unique, stable identifier (like `id`) rather than array index
- **What happens without it**: React will show warnings and may not update efficiently

**Understanding JSX in loops:**

```javascript
mealsDisplay.push(
    <li key={meals[i].id}> 
        {meals[i].meal_name} by {meals[i].guest_name} serves {meals[i].serves} ( {meals[i].kind_of_dish} ) 
    </li>
)
```

- **JSX elements**: We're creating React elements (not HTML strings)
- **Template literals**: Using `{variable}` to insert JavaScript values into JSX
- **Array building**: We build an array of JSX elements, then render it all at once

**Alternative approaches:**

You could also use `.map()` instead of a for loop:
```javascript
const mealsDisplay = meals.map(meal => (
    <li key={meal.id}>
        {meal.meal_name} by {meal.guest_name} serves {meal.serves} ({meal.kind_of_dish})
    </li>
));

# Level 10: Add Event Handler

**Goal:** Create the handleAddMeal function to process form submissions.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a form handler so that I can process the form data when users submit it.

---

## What You'll Do

Add the `handleAddMeal` function to your component to handle form submissions.

## Instructions

- Create an `async function handleAddMeal(event)` that:
  - Calls `event.preventDefault()` to prevent page refresh
  - Logs "handle add meal submitted" to console
  - Extracts form data using `event.target.elements`
  - Creates a `newMeal` object with the form data
  - Converts serves to an integer using `parseInt(serves)`
  - Logs the newMeal object to console
  - Adds a comment indicating we'll add insert logic in the next step

    const guestName = event.target.elements.guestName.value
    const serves = event.target.elements.serves.value
    const kindOfDish = event.target.elements.kindOfDish.value
    
    const newMeal = {
        meal_name: mealName,
        guest_name: guestName,
        serves: parseInt(serves),
        kind_of_dish: kindOfDish
    }
    
    console.log(newMeal)
    // We'll add the insert logic in the next step
}
</code></pre>

</details>

## üîç Diving Deeper

**Understanding form events:**

- **`event.preventDefault()`**: Stops the browser's default form submission behavior (page refresh)
- **`event.target`**: References the form element that triggered the event
- **`event.target.elements`**: Collection of all form input elements with `name` attributes
- **Why we need it**: Without preventDefault, the page would refresh and lose our React state

**Exploring the event object:**

To better understand how events work, try adding this to your form handler:

```javascript
function handleAddMeal(event) {
    console.log(event); // Examine the entire event object
    console.log(event.target); // Look at the form element
    console.log(event.target.elements); // See all form inputs
    
    event.preventDefault();
    // ... rest of your code
}
```

**What you'll see in the console:**
- **`event`**: A large object with many properties (type, target, preventDefault, etc.)
- **`event.target`**: The `<form>` element that was submitted
- **`event.target.elements`**: A collection of all inputs with `name` attributes

**Form data extraction pattern:**

```javascript
const mealName = event.target.elements.mealName.value
const guestName = event.target.elements.guestName.value
```

- **`elements.mealName`**: Gets the input with `name="mealName"`
- **`.value`**: Gets the current value from that input
- **Uncontrolled inputs**: We're not using React state to control the input values
- **Alternative**: Could use `useState` for each field (controlled inputs), but this is simpler

**Data type conversion:**

```javascript
serves: parseInt(serves)
```

- **`parseInt()`**: Converts string to integer
- **Why needed**: HTML form inputs always return strings, but our database expects numbers
- **Error handling**: `parseInt("abc")` returns `NaN` - in production, you'd validate this

**Object creation pattern:**

```javascript
const newMeal = {
    meal_name: mealName,
    guest_name: guestName,
    serves: parseInt(serves),
    kind_of_dish: kindOfDish
}
```

- **Property mapping**: Database column names (`meal_name`) vs. form field names (`mealName`)
- **Data structure**: Creating an object that matches our database schema
- **Consistency**: This object structure must match what Supabase expects

# Level 11: Create Insert RLS Policy

**Goal:** Set up a write policy for your potluck_meals table.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure database security policies so that users can insert new meals into the database.

---

## What You'll Do

Follow the Supabase Setup Guide to set up a write policy for your potluck_meals table.

## Instructions

- Follow the [Supabase Setup Guide - Step 11](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.html#step-11-set-up-write-policy-allow-public-write-access) to set up a write policy
- Click **"New Policy"** in your Supabase dashboard
- Give it a policy name (e.g., "Enable insert for all users")
- Select **"INSERT"** operation
- Add `true` to the **"with check"** statement in the policy
- Click **"Save"**

This allows anyone to **create** new rows in your table.

**üîí Cybersecurity Reflection**: Think about this statement from a security perspective. What are the potential risks of allowing "anyone" to create new rows in your database? Consider:
- What could happen if malicious users submit inappropriate data?
- How might this policy affect data integrity?
- What would be a more secure approach for a production application?
- Why is this policy acceptable for learning projects but not for real applications?

**Note**: This policy is intentionally permissive for learning purposes. In production applications, you would implement proper authentication and authorization controls.

# Level 12: Add Insert Statement

**Goal:** Update your form handler to insert new meals into the database.

**User Story:** As a user, I want my form submission to save the meal to the database so that it persists and can be retrieved later.

---

## What You'll Do

Update your `handleAddMeal` function to include the database insertion logic.

## Instructions

- Update your `handleAddMeal` function to include the insert logic
- Use `await supabase.from("potluck_meals").insert(newMeal)` to insert the new meal
- Keep all the existing form processing logic
- Test the complete flow: submit form ‚Üí see data in database

## üîç Diving Deeper

**Understanding CRUD operations:**

- **C**reate: `INSERT` - Adding new records to the database
- **R**ead: `SELECT` - Retrieving data from the database  
- **U**pdate: `UPDATE` - Modifying existing records
- **D**elete: `DELETE` - Removing records from the database

**Database insertion explained:**

```javascript
await supabase.from("potluck_meals").insert(newMeal)
```

- **`supabase.from("table_name")`**: Specifies which table to insert into
- **`.insert(data)`**: Inserts the provided data as a new row
- **`await`**: Waits for the insertion to complete before continuing
- **No return value needed**: We're not using the returned data, just inserting

**Exploring network requests:**

To see what's actually being sent to Supabase, open your browser's Developer Tools:

1. **Open Developer Tools**: Press `F12` or right-click ‚Üí "Inspect"
2. **Go to Network Tab**: Click on the "Network" tab
3. **Submit your form**: Fill out and submit the form
4. **Look for the request**: You'll see a request to your Supabase URL
5. **Examine the data**: Click on the request to see:
   - **Request Payload**: The data being sent (your `newMeal` object)
   - **Response**: What Supabase sends back
   - **Headers**: Authentication and other metadata

**What you'll see:**
- **Request URL**: `https://your-project.supabase.co/rest/v1/potluck_meals`
- **Request Method**: `POST` (for inserting data)
- **Request Payload**: Your form data as JSON
- **Response**: Confirmation that the data was inserted

**Data persistence:**

- **Before insert**: Data only exists in your React component's memory
- **After insert**: Data is permanently stored in the Supabase database
- **Verification**: You can check the Supabase dashboard to see the new record
- **Retrieval**: The data will be available even after refreshing the page

**Error handling considerations:**

In production apps, you'd want to handle potential errors:
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.from("potluck_meals").insert(newMeal)
if (error) {
    console.error('Insert failed:', error);
    // Show user-friendly error message
} else {
    console.log('Meal added successfully:', data);
    // Update UI to show success
}
```

**Database constraints:**

- **Required fields**: Database will reject inserts if required columns are missing
- **Data types**: Database will reject inserts if data types don't match (e.g., string in integer column)
- **Unique constraints**: Database will reject duplicate values in unique columns
- **Foreign keys**: Database will reject inserts that violate relationship rules
