# React + Supabase Potluck App Project Guide

Welcome! You're about to build your first full-stack React application with a real database. By the end of this project, you'll have created a potluck meal management app that can store, display, and manage data - just like the apps you use every day!

**What you'll learn:**
- Connect React to a real database (Supabase)
- Build forms that save data permanently
- Display data from a database in your app
- Handle user interactions and events
- Work with database security and permissions

**How this works:**
- Each level builds on what you learned before
- Follow the instructions step-by-step
- Use the code hints when you get stuck
- Check your work with the verification steps
- Start simple and gradually add more features

**Each level includes:**
- **User Story**: What you're building and why it matters
- **Instructions**: Step-by-step guidance to complete the task
- **Code Hints**: Examples and snippets to help you along (use only if you need it.)
- **Diving Deeper**: Extra explanations and videos for curious minds
- **Check**: Verification steps to make sure everything works

## Level 1: Planning

**Goal:** Plan your potluck app using the [activity guide](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/db-mini-project/ACTIVITY_GUIDE.html).

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to plan my database structure and components so that I can build my potluck management app efficiently.

---

### ðŸ“‹ Before You Start

**Complete the Activity Guide first!** Work through Steps 1-4 of the Activity Guide to:
- Plan your database tables
- Design your component structure
- Map out your app's features
- Set success criteria

This planning will help you build your app more efficiently!

---

### What You'll Do

Take time to plan your potluck app using the structured activity guide.

### Instructions

- **Understand the Requirements**: Review what you need to build
- **Plan Your Database**: Design your tables and relationships
- **Plan Your Components**: Break down your app into manageable pieces
- **Set Success Criteria**: Know what "done" looks like

**Key Planning Questions:**
- What data will you store in each table?
- What components will you need to create?
- How will users interact with your app?
- What features will make your app unique?

**Time Investment**: Spend 15-20 minutes on planning - it will save you hours of debugging later!

### âœ… Check

1. You have reviewed the activity guide
2. You understand the project requirements
3. You have planned your database structure
4. You have designed your component architecture
5. You have set clear success criteria
