# Level 11: Create Insert RLS Policy

**Goal:** Set up a write policy for your potluck_meals table.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure database security policies so that users can insert new meals into the database.

---

## What You'll Do

Follow the Supabase Setup Guide to set up a write policy for your potluck_meals table.

## Instructions

- Follow the [Supabase Setup Guide - Step 11](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.html#step-11-set-up-write-policy-allow-public-write-access) to set up a write policy
- Click **"New Policy"** in your Supabase dashboard
- Give it a policy name (e.g., "Enable insert for all users")
- Select **"INSERT"** operation
- Add `true` to the **"with check"** statement in the policy
- Click **"Save"**

This allows anyone to **create** new rows in your table.

**ðŸ”’ Cybersecurity Reflection**: Think about this statement from a security perspective. What are the potential risks of allowing "anyone" to create new rows in your database? Consider:
- What could happen if malicious users submit inappropriate data?
- How might this policy affect data integrity?
- What would be a more secure approach for a production application?
- Why is this policy acceptable for learning projects but not for real applications?

**Note**: This policy is intentionally permissive for learning purposes. In production applications, you would implement proper authentication and authorization controls.

## âœ… Check

1. You have created a new RLS policy
2. The policy allows INSERT operations
3. The policy uses `true` in the "with check" statement
4. The policy is saved and active
5. You understand the security implications
