# Level 3: Database Setup

**Goal:** Configure your Supabase database with tables and security policies.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up my database tables and security policies so that I can store and retrieve potluck data securely.

---

## What You'll Do

Follow the Supabase setup guides to create your database tables and configure access policies.

## Instructions

- Complete the [Supabase Setup Guide](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.html) to create your account and project
- Create a `potluck_meals` table with these columns:
  - `meal_name` (text)
  - `guest_name` (text)
  - `serves` (integer)
  - `kind_of_dish` (text)
- Add at least 3 sample meals
- Set up [read policies](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.html#step-10-set-up-read-policy-allow-public-read-access) and [insert policies](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.html#step-11-set-up-write-policy-allow-public-write-access) for public access
- Follow the [Supabase React Setup Guide](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_REACT_SETUP_GUIDE.html) to configure environment variables
  - Remember to:
    - install your libraries. (supabase and tslib) [instructions](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_REACT_SETUP_GUIDE.html#step-7-install-supabase-client-library)
    - create your `.env.local` file in your project's **root** directory [instructions](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_REACT_SETUP_GUIDE.html#fix-3-use-envlocal-for-better-security)
    - create your supabase utility file in `src/util` Note: do not copy the code for `App.jsx` for this project. We will put the code into a component in later steps [instructions](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_REACT_SETUP_GUIDE.html#fix-3-use-envlocal-for-better-security)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note**: Do NOT use the starter code for `App.jsx` from the Supabase setup guide. That code puts everything in one file, but we'll be organizing our app into separate components. Follow the component structure outlined in Levels 4-6 below instead.

## üîç Diving Deeper

**What are Row Level Security (RLS) policies?**

- **Purpose**: Control who can access which rows in your database
- **Security layer**: Prevents unauthorized access to your data
- **Policy types**: SELECT (read), INSERT (create), UPDATE (modify), DELETE (remove)
- **Why we need them**: Without RLS, anyone with your database URL could access all your data

**Understanding our policies:**

```sql
-- Read policy: Allow everyone to read meals
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for all users" ON potluck_meals
FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Insert policy: Allow everyone to add meals  
CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for all users" ON potluck_meals
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
```

- **`USING (true)`**: For SELECT policies, means "allow if condition is true" (always true = everyone can read)
- **`WITH CHECK (true)`**: For INSERT policies, means "allow if condition is true" (always true = everyone can insert)
- **`true`**: Always evaluates to true, so these policies allow public access

**Environment variables explained:**

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

- **`VITE_` prefix**: Required for Vite to include these variables in your build
- **`.env.local`**: More secure than `.env` (automatically ignored by git)
- **Anon key**: Safe to use in frontend code (has limited permissions)
- **Service key**: Never use in frontend (has full database access)

## ‚úÖ Check

1. Your Supabase project is created and accessible
2. The `potluck_meals` table exists with the correct columns
3. You have sample data in your table
4. RLS policies are enabled and configured
5. Environment variables are set up in your React project
6. You can see your data in the Supabase dashboard
