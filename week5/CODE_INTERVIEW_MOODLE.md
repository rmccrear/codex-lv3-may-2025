# Prepare for Your TA Code Review

Your TA will conduct a **15-20 minute code review** with you during class time. This is your opportunity to demonstrate your understanding and explain your work.

**üìÇ Choose Your Project:** Select **ONE project** to present during your code review:

1. **Week 2: Portfolio Website** - [Project Instructions](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week2/mini-project-portfolio/README.html)
   - React components, props, and component organization
   
2. **Week 3: React Clicker Game** - [Project Instructions](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week3/react-clicker-game-mini-project/react-clicker-game-lv-1.html)
   - State management with `useState`, event handlers, and game logic
   
3. **Week 4: Hackathon Multi-Page App** - [Project Instructions](https://rmccrear.github.io/codex-lv3-may-2025/week4/week4-day-2-activity.html)
   - Navigation, multiple components, data handling with arrays

## üîç What to Expect

### 1. **Demo Your App (3-5 minutes)**
- What does your app do?
- How does the user interact with it?
- Show the key features working

### 2. **Explain Your Code (5-7 minutes)**
Walk through key parts of your code:
- Event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.)
- Functions and how they work
- Variables and state management
- Conditionals and logic (`if` statements, ternary operators)
- How components are organized

### 3. **Live-Edit Challenge (5-7 minutes)**
You'll be asked to make a small change to your code, such as:
- Add a new button with an event handler
- Change a conditional statement
- Update a screen element or style
- Modify state or props

### 4. **Reflection (2-3 minutes)**
Be ready to answer:
- "What was the hardest part of building this?"
- "What would you add or change with more time?"
- "What did you learn from this project?"

## ‚úÖ How to Prepare

**Before your code review:**
- [ ] Choose which project you'll present (Week 2, 3, or 4)
- [ ] Test your app to make sure it runs without errors
- [ ] Review your code and understand how each part works
- [ ] Be ready to open and navigate your code files
- [ ] Think about the choices you made and why
- [ ] Practice explaining your code out loud
- [ ] Have your project open in VS Code and ready to edit

**What to review:**
- How your components are structured
- How state updates work (`useState`, setter functions)
- How props are passed between components
- How event handlers trigger functions
- How data flows through your app

## üí° Tips for Success

**Focus on:**
- **Explaining HOW your code works** - not just what it does
- **Explaining WHY you wrote it that way** - show your thinking
- **Being honest** - it's okay to say "I'm not sure" or "I'd like to improve this"
- **Your developer mindset** - how you solve problems and debug

**Don't worry about:**
- Perfect code - we're looking for understanding, not perfection
- Memorizing syntax - you can reference documentation
- Knowing everything - learning is the goal

## üéØ What TAs Are Looking For

‚úÖ **Understanding:** Do you know how your code works?  
‚úÖ **Explanation:** Can you articulate your decisions and logic?  
‚úÖ **Problem-Solving:** Can you make changes and debug?  
‚úÖ **Growth Mindset:** Are you learning from challenges?

## üìÖ Schedule

Code reviews will be conducted during class time. Check the schedule posted in the class forum for your assigned time slot.

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes per student  
**Format:** One-on-one with TA  
**Setup:** Have your project open and running
