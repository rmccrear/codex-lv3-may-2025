Setting up a Database on Supabase

* [Supabase Setup Guide](./week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

Interacting with a database from React. 

* [Supabase React Setup Guide](./week5/supabase-setup/SUPABASE_REACT_SETUP_GUIDE.md) - Complete guide with code examples

Goals for the day:

These goals are not an assignment, but are good practice for what comes next.

1. Setup Supabase and one table
2. Add at least 3 rows to your table
3. Access the rows from your table in a React App
4. Challenge: Try making a second table and repeating the process.
5. Challenge Try filtering your data.
